Welcome to SpM's documentation!
===============================
This is a documentation of Sparse Modeling (SpM) tool for analytical continuation.

What is SpM ?
-------------
A sparse-modeling tool for computing the spectral function from the imaginary-time Green function. It removes statistical errors in quantum Monte Carlo data, and performs a stable analytical continuation. The obtained spectral function fulfills the non-negativity and the sum rule. The computation is fast and free from tuning parameters.
